Before running the program all files need to be downloaded and put in the same file. You may need to install the following python libraries:
pandas,
numpy,
sklearn,
matplotlib

The program will plot the graphs from the report one by one, in the order they appear in the report. You have to close the current plot to see the next one. One of the plots takes a long time to compute, since it is based on the permutation importance method.
